### Changed
- Summary
	- new items
	- choice of items displayed
	- choose from genre, dates, locale, popular/latest, other [mood, members, composers, last.fm listeners, lengths] - depending on source (display tab)
	<!-- - custom colour option (custom tab). Heading (normally highlight colour), text & summary colours can now all be independently set -->
	<!--- font style now configurable (display tab) -->
- Custom colours and font styles
	- heading (normally highlight colour), summary & text can now all be independently set (custom, display & headings tabs)
- Improvements to tagger (tagger tab + see release notes below)
- Reinstated the image seeker bar & improved the image seeker positioning with certain layout styles
- Settings are now stored in package_data folder
    - Biography.cfg should be copied automatically (original is retained for back-compatibility with v1.2.0, else it can be deleted)
    - Language & language fallback settings will be reset, as a consequence of adding multi-language support for Wikipedia (download tab)
- Removed the ability to auto-update from old versions (v1.1.3 or earlier)

### Fix
- Wine stabilisation: biography should no longer give errors in Wine, but some limitations remain:
    - Paste from clipboard may not work. It's rarely used. The only use is to create custom biographies & album reviews that can be created in a text editor anyway (include 'Custom Biography' or 'Custom Review', respectively, at end to stop overwriting)
    - Recycler may not work. It's rarely used. If used, the console gives an alternative
    - Options dialog may not load: menu now indicates there was a problem & console explains what can be done instead
- Blocked unnecessary on_size calls from Panel Stack Splitter with certain of its layout methods

### Release notes
#### Tagger
###### Last.fm
- a whitelist is now used to filter out non-genres that can be present
- statistics are now written as a multivalue tag: playcount (scrobbles), listeners & a combined score (1-100). Scores rank the long-term popularity of artists and albums on a 1-100 scale using accumulated last.fm playcount (scrobbles) and listeners

```View by score: possible view for library tree: $nodisplay{$sub(9999,$meta(Artist Statistics Last.fm,5[score]))}[$meta(Artist Statistics Last.fm,5[score]) - ]%artist%|$nodisplay{$sub(9999,$meta(Album Statistics Last.fm,5[score]))}[$meta(Album Statistics Last.fm,5[score]) - ]$if2(%album%,ÎµXtra)|[[%discnumber%.]%tracknumber%. ][%track artist% - ]%title%```

- Additionally, Find & Play can write track statistics to tag, where that data is more relevant. See the Find & Play [changelog](https://github.com/Wil-B/Find-and-Play/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#track-popularity-tagger) for an example of a fully comprehensive popularity view

###### Wikipedia
- added option to tag genres

#### Wikipedia biographies and reviews
<!-- - Searches are integrated with MusicBrainz
- MusicBrainz provides all the biography links
- MusicBrainz is tried first for review links, but isn't comprehensive, and there is a fallback to a direct search of Wikipedia
- Genres can be in native language or limited to English (latter fallback to MusicBrainz)
- Optionally musicbrainz_XXXXid and MusicBrainz XXXX Id tags are supported where XXXX is artist, releasegroup (release group for latter) or work -->
- Searches optionally support musicbrainz_XXXXid and MusicBrainz XXXX Id tags. XXXX can be artist, releasegroup (release group for latter) or work
- Generally such tags shouldn't be needed. They may be useful if names differ to site names, e.g. classical works (compositions) can be variously named
<!-- - Rarely will such tags offer any benefit. Best use case may be where there are naming differences, e.g. classical works (compositions) have various naming methods
searches support the following tags: musicbrainz_XXXXid and MusicBrainz XXXX Id; where XXXX is artist, releasegroup (release group for latter) or work -->
